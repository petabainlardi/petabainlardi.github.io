		In <i>Understanding Comics</i>, author Scott McCloud gives his readers a different perspective on comics, how they can sometimes be misconceived, and the history behind them. He describes how people often have very narrow definitions of what a comic a is. McCloud follows plenty of examples showing a new perspective, and explaining how much freedom there is in comics for comic book artists because you can have any type/amount of images and text.

		Comics are often used to focus attention on things we don’t often think about in everyday life and is able to portray emotions and senses. McCloud explains how important it is for a comic book artist to portray an emotions and sense to get a response from the readers. It was very eye opening when he began to use the example of smell in comics, because in reality we obviously can’t see smell, but comic book artist use symbols like squiggly lines or flies which tells its readers it smells bad. I found that eye opening to the importance of details in all forms of art to help people to understand and respond in the intended way.
