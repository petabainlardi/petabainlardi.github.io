		Quick Summary
	</h3>

	<p>	
		John Berger’s ‘Ways of Seeing’ is compelling due to the fact that it shows its audience a different perspective on our lives as human beings. It also questions the perspective we have on the world now and vice versa. Berger mostly compares art and technology as an example of how the world could be different if we looked at it from a different perspective.

	<p>
		What really stood out through out the episodes was when he mentioned women in traditional renaissance art, the standards of beauty, and how that is portrayed with art. Women in traditional renaissance art, particularly in Europe, were often shown as nude, demoralized, and beat down by a strictly patriarchal society. Looking at art with a different perspective can help reveal more of the story and history behind it.
