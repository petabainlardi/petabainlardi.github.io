                <p> Mountain gorillas are a subspecies of the Eastern gorilla which has now split into two, scientists argue whether has now become two separate subspecies. The Mountain gorilla subspecies has experienced so much devastation over time, since their discovery in 1902, that many assumed they would be extinct by the end of the twentieth century. This is due to threats such as hunting, destruction of habitats, war and disease. More than half of their population can be found in the Virunga Mountains, which are a range of extinct volcanoes that border three African countries, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda. The rest of the population lives in Uganda's Bwinidi Impenetrable National Park.</p>

                                <p class="card-text"> Mountain gorillas, obviously due to their name, live in forests at elevations of 8,000 to 13,000 feet high in the mountains. They have specific evolved features like thicker coats of furs to help them survive in situations in which their habitats can reach tempertures below freezing. As humans encroach on their territory more and more over the years, it made the Mountain gorillas go higher up into the mountains and for longer periods of time. Due to this shift, it forced the gorillas to suffer through both dangerous and sometimes deadly conditions. In the last couple decades despite ongoing human threats, because of conservation efforts both Mountain gorilla subspecies population has increased.
