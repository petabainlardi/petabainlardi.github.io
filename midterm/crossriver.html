                <p> Scientists have not been able to thoroughly study the habitats and population of the Cross River gorilla until the last decade or so. This is due to the fact the gorillas are scared of human so they prefer to inhabit rugged terrain. This makes it extremely difficult for scientists to count these gorillas
                    directly. Now researchers use indirect signs, like estimated range and nests to make an aproximate count. They have determined using that process that there are only about 200 to 300 of these gorillas left in the wild. Cross River gorillas are currently scattered across the lowland montane forests and rainforests of Cameroon and Nigeria. Which is an area of 3,000 square miles, or about twice the size of Rhode
                    Island.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Due to the fact that Cross River gorillas are a subspecies of the Western Lowland gorilla, they are very similar in appearance, but small differences can be seen in the skull and teeth. Cross River gorillas live in a region populated by many humans. Because of this their territory has been almost cleared for wood and to make fields for agriculture and livestock. People also participate in poaching in the forests. It is obvious that even the loss of a few Cross River gorillas is detrimental to their population.
