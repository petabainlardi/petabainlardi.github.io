                <p> The Eastern Lowland gorilla (also known as Grauerâ€™s gorilla) is the largest of the four gorilla subspecies. Physical differences from other gorilla species include large hands, a short muzzle, and a stocky body. Just like other gorilla subspecies, despite the Eastern Lowland gorillas size, it eats mainly fruits and other plant like materials.</p>

                                <p class="card-text"> The Eastern Lowland gorilla lives in the lowland tropical rainforests in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Like the Mountain gorilla, civil unrest in their territory has had a detrimental effect on their population. Within the last 50 years their range has decreased almost half the size, from around 8,100 square miles to about 4,600 square miles. Similar to their range of territory, the Eastern Lowland gorilla's population has also decreased to about 50%, from about 17,000 in the mid-1990's to around 8,500 since then. Although an accurate count of their population has been impossible for scientists for many years due to the devastation in their region. Even in protected national parks like the Kahuzi-Biega, Eastern Lowland gorillas can succumb to poaching, although organizations like WWF and the park staff are doing their best to reestablish control over the land.
